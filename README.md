 *My first experiments with coding and generative art using Processing. (repo in progress)*

 Processing is a software sketchbook and a Java-based language for learning how to code, created by Ben Fry and Casey Reas in 2001. It has a large community of developers, artists, and artist-developers working on and with it.

I was looking for a new medium of expression when I stumbled upon generative art. At first, I thought it was not for me: I am a creative person, I do music, I write, but I definitely did not consider myself as a science or math-oriented person. Well, that limited vision of myself changed when I discovered the joy that a few lines of code can create.

Here are some early studies, the beginning of my journey into the code world and generative art.
